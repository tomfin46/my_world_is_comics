They devised a scheme to recharge their ship's energy cells using the electrical energy of Korbal's lightning beasts. They underestimated the beasts' power and were all bathed in bio-electric energy.

When his sister arrived to join the Legion as Winath's official representative, Garth quit in shame. He went on to work for the industrialist <a href=\"/leland-mccauley/4005-12846/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-12846\">Leland McCauley</a> on his <a href=\"/workforce/4060-47189/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-47189\">Workforce</a> team. Garth had hoped to make some money to look for his brother, but quit the team soon after due to McCauley's lack of morals. Despite aiding the Legion against Daxamite terrorists, Garth was still not allowed to rejoin, so he went off again to find his brother. When he found Mekt, his mind had snapped, and he was a deadly criminal. Mekt abducted Garth and shot his right arm off. After recovering from his battle with Mekt and gaining a cybernetic arm, Garth worked with a newly formed Espionage Squad to uncover the corruption of <a href=\"/president-chu/4005-21136/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-21136\">President Chu</a>. She was impeached, and Brande was made president in her place.

They were now a teen youth movement and Garth coined their first battle cry: \"Eat it, Grandpa!\" He was dating Saturn Girl, and said that the only way to successfully date a telepath was to be \"way honest.\" He was instrumental in gaining legal status for the Legion, but forgot to read the fine print in the agreement - the U.P. now had the right to use the Legion's image in any way they wished. When Cosmic Boy disappeared after the Dominators attempted to take over Earth, a public election was held for Legion leadership. <a href=\"/supergirl/4005-2351/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2351\">Supergirl</a> was elected with Lightning Lad her deputy. She soon left for the 21st century and Garth became the team leader. Garth was quickly overwhelmed with the responsibilities of leadership, especially dealing with the various organizations of the United Planets. This put a strain in he and Saturn Girl's relationship which led her to have a psychic affair. She confessed the indiscretion and Garth broke up with her.</p><h3>Retroboot: New Earth</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/36257/1093603-lightninglad_bycinar.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1093603\" data-size=\"medium\" style=\"width: 815px\" data-ratio=\"1.4466257668712\" data-width=\"815\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:144.7%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/36257/1093603-lightninglad_bycinar.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1093603\"><img alt=\"Lightning Lad (New Earth)\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/36257/1093603-lightninglad_bycinar.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/36257/1093603-lightninglad_bycinar.jpg 815w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/36257/1093603-lightninglad_bycinar.jpg 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Lightning Lad (New Earth)\" src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/36257/1093603-lightninglad_bycinar.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/36257/1093603-lightninglad_bycinar.jpg 815w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/36257/1093603-lightninglad_bycinar.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Lightning Lad (New Earth)</figcaption></figure><p><a href=\"/infinite-crisis/4045-40765/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-40765\">Infinite Crisis</a> restored the original Legion continuity from before Five Years Later.

Live Wire sacrificed himself fighting their former teammate, <a href=\"../../element-lad/29-1263/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Element Lad</a>, who had spent billions of years becoming a mad god.</p><h4>Garth's Body Restored</h4><p>Garth's spirit, however, was stored in the living crystals of <a href=\"../../element-lad/29-1263/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Element Lad</a>'s corpse, and he was able to return to the Legion - but in Element Lad's body. This caused a lot of anxiety among the Legion, but eventually his friends came to accept Garth. When Earth-247 was destroyed in <a href=\"../../infinite-crisis/39-40765/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Infinite Crisis</a>, Garth and his team survived because they had been lost in the timestream. Garth's original body was eventually restored when the <a href=\"../../brainiac-5/29-1255/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Brainiac 5</a> of New Earth used a special lightning rod to help Garth transmute himself to normal. He then rejoined his team as they pushed into the <a href=\"../../dc-multiverse/12-43603/\" rel=\"nofollow\">multiverse</a> as the new <a href=\"../../wanderers/65-47418/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Wanderers</a>.</p><h2>Powers &amp; Abilities</h2><h3>Electricity Control</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/26503/506307-sensor26.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-506307\" data-size=\"medium\" style=\"width: 646px\" data-ratio=\"1.3312693498452\" data-width=\"646\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:133.1%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/26503/506307-sensor26.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-506307\"><img alt=\"Lightning Powers\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/2/26503/506307-sensor26.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/26503/506307-sensor26.jpg 646w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/2/26503/506307-sensor26.jpg 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Lightning Powers\" src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/2/26503/506307-sensor26.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/26503/506307-sensor26.jpg 646w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/2/26503/506307-sensor26.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Lightning Powers</figcaption></figure><p>Lightning Lad has the ability to generate electricity and direct bolts of electricity accurately. Lightning Lad can use his power destructively, such as to short-circuit electrical items, split boulders, burn objects with precision or shatter walls. He can also reduce the force of his bolts so that they will only stun. He can send his electricity through conductive metals. He has a degree of immunity to electrical charge; in fact, they give him more strength to use his power. In some instances he has a robotic right arm that is powered by his lightning power.</p><h3>Equipment</h3><p>As a member of the Legion of Super-Heroes, Lightning Lad possesses a <a href=\"../../legion-flight-ring/18-47353/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Legion Flight Ring</a>. The ring gives its wearer the ability to fly, the speed and range of which is determined by the wearer's willpower. It also acts as a long-range communicator (enabling constant vocal contact with other Legionnaires, even across vast distances of space), a signal device, and a navigational compass, all powered by a micro-computer built inside the ring.</p><h2>Other Versions</h2><h3>Silver Age: Lightning Man</h3><p>In the original debut of the Legion of Supervillians, this team came from a time when the Legion of Superheroes had reach adulthood.

He had an origin similar to the comic books, though this time his sister Ayla didn't survive the attack by the lightning beasts as children. This same event also left Garth with a lightning bolt scar over one eye, which lit up when he used his powers. During the two seasons of the show, Garth had a flirtation with Saturn Girl but never properly developed a romance. He often butted heads with fellow co-founder Cosmic Boy on issues and Saturn Girl specifically. He appeared in every episode of season one and all but \"Cry Wolf\", \"Unnatural Alliances\", and \"Trials\" in season two.</p><p>In season one, Garth joined the Legion of Super-Villains to be with his brother Mekt and leave behind his immature Legion teammates but quickly learned the team wasn't for him. In season two, Garth lost his arm to his brother and <a href=\"/imperiex/4005-10006/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-10006\">Imperiex</a> and was given a cybernetic one.

Naltor's native denizens are genetically inclined to be precognitives, with the ability to see into the future. At a young age, Nura became recognized as the most powerful precog among her people, more able to dream with peculiar accuracy, or see a few moments into the future while awake, than any other. Nura's exceptional beauty often hid the fact that she was also exceptionally bright, and once she reached adulthood, she had already mastered advanced Naltorian science, putting her among the galaxy's intellectual elite. Nura eventually left Naltor to act on one her visions in which she foresaw the death of several members of the <a href=\"/legion-of-super-heroes/4060-19241/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-19241\">Legion of Super-Heroes</a> on a mission in space. Determined to prevent their deaths, she introduced herself to the Legion using the code name of Dream Girl.</p><h2>Creation</h2><p>Dream Girl was created in 1964 by writer <a href=\"/edmond-hamilton/4040-42401/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-42401\">Edmond Hamilton</a> and artist <a href=\"/john-forte/4040-7532/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-7532\">John Forte</a>, first appearing in <a href=\"/adventure-comics/4050-3105/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-3105\">Adventure Comics</a> #310. She became the sixth female member of the Legion of Super-Heroes and their 20th member overall. As her code name would suggest, Dream Girl was portrayed as the most glamorous member of the Legion, and she was envisioned as a <a href=\"../../marilyn-monroe/29-16582/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Marilyn Monroe</a>-like beauty complete with platinum-blonde hair, revealing silver costumes, high heels, and a star-shaped birthmark on her right cheek.

At one of the Legion's open try-outs, Nura introduced herself as Dream Girl, gaining the attention of the male Legionnaires and the ire of the female Legionnaires. One Legionnaire fell in love with her at first sight, <a href=\"/starman/4005-1260/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1260\">Star Boy</a>. The male Legionnaires voted her in to the team. Immediately, Dream Girl studied the Legion Constitution, to discover ways to expel the doomed Legionnaires from the team. One by one, she sabotaged them, including <a href=\"/lightning-lass/4005-30997/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-30997\">Lightning Lass</a>, who had her electrical powers seemingly removed by Nura's Naltorian science. The vision Nura had, turned out to be a vision of a test the Legion was doing with crash test dummies that looked like the Legionnaires. Dream Girl also revealed that Lightning Lass' powers had changed from electrical control to the nullification of gravity.</p><p>Once the truth of Dream Girl's scheme came out, the Legionnaires invited Dream Girl to stay on the team because she had their best interests in mind. Dream Girl declined the invitation, deciding instead to get more training in her abilities. Dream Girl joined the <a href=\"/legion-of-substitute-heroes/4060-47111/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-47111\">Legion of Substitute Heroes</a> so she would have time to practice and perfect her visions. Later, after Star Boy lost his kryptonian-level powers, and followed her to the Substitute Legion and started their romance. Finally, when it appeared that <a href=\"/supergirl/4005-2351/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2351\">Supergirl</a> and <a href=\"/superman/4005-1807/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1807\">Superboy</a> were leaving the Legion of Super-Heroes, Star Boy and Dream Girl rejoined the team.</p><p>With her stunning pinup-girl looks and figure, a flirty swimsuit-like costume (which she wore even prior to the Legion's sexy-costume era of the 70's), and boldly confident personality, the male Legionnaires completely stopped noticing the other female members on the team, and the female Legionnaires soon grew jealous and resentful. Never one to back down from a challenge, Dream Girl made an effort to reach out to her female teammates, gradually winning them over and befriending them with her natural charm and charisma.</p><p> </p><h3>Reboot: Earth-247</h3><figure data-ref-id=\"1300-1982181\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/83063/1982181-dreamy15.jpg\" data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" style=\"width: 328px\" data-ratio=\"2.6036585365854\" data-width=\"328\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:260.4%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/83063/1982181-dreamy15.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1982181\"><img alt=\"Dream Girl (Earth-247)\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 245px) 100vw, 245px\" data-width=\"245\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/8/83063/1982181-dreamy15.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/83063/1982181-dreamy15.jpg 328w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/8/83063/1982181-dreamy15.jpg 245w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Dream Girl (Earth-247)\" src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/8/83063/1982181-dreamy15.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/83063/1982181-dreamy15.jpg 328w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/8/83063/1982181-dreamy15.jpg 245w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 245px) 100vw, 245px\" data-width=\"245\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Dream Girl (Earth-247)</figcaption></figure><p>Nura claimed that her name was Nura Schappin, changing her surname to Nal because, as she put it, \"It just says I'm from Naltor y'know.\" She also claimed to have been the first precognitive to be born on Naltor in seven generations, a claim that was later contradicted by other post-<i>Zero Hour</i> Legion stories. For most of this continuity's duration, Nura was not a Legionnaire, although she was still Star Boy's girlfriend. Additionally, she suffered from narcolepsy, falling unconscious whenever she had a vision. She was no longer the sister of <a href=\"/black-witch/4005-30998/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-30998\">Mysa</a>, who was completely unrelated to her in this continuity. Eventually, Nura gained Legion membership under the codename Dreamer. Unlike other continuities her Legion costume featured a cape, as well as a diamond-shaped \"cleavage window\" in the front.</p><h3>Threeboot: Earth-Prime</h3><figure data-ref-id=\"1300-1534216\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/29837/1534216-dreamgirl_3boot.jpg\" data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" style=\"width: 324px\" data-ratio=\"2.141975308642\" data-width=\"324\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:214.2%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/29837/1534216-dreamgirl_3boot.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1534216\"><img alt=\"Dream Girl (Earth-Prime)\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 298px) 100vw, 298px\" data-width=\"298\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/2/29837/1534216-dreamgirl_3boot.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/29837/1534216-dreamgirl_3boot.jpg 324w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/2/29837/1534216-dreamgirl_3boot.jpg 298w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Dream Girl (Earth-Prime)\" src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/2/29837/1534216-dreamgirl_3boot.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/29837/1534216-dreamgirl_3boot.jpg 324w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/2/29837/1534216-dreamgirl_3boot.jpg 298w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 298px) 100vw, 298px\" data-width=\"298\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Dream Girl (Earth-Prime)</figcaption></figure><p>Dream Girl had a more disconnected and \"spaced out\" personality in this continuity, since her precognition often interfered with her perception of current reality and she had trouble differentiating between the two. She wore a midriff-baring costume with a silver top and black leggings. In her first action as a Legionnaire she stopped an assassination attempt on the United Planets delegates by a spy. <a href=\"../../brainiac-5/29-1255/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Brainiac 5</a> had compiled data for three days and sent Dream Girl, <a href=\"../../karate-kid/29-1269/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Karate Kid</a>, and <a href=\"../../element-lad/29-1263/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Element Lad</a> to stop the assassin. The Legionnaires looked like they were beaten, until Karate Kid woke Dream Girl from a daydream and she took down the assassin down with ease, saying that she thought they had already defeated him. Afterwards, Brainiac 5 announced that Dream Girl's precog power frustrated him to no end because there was no rationality to it and it was not scientific. Dream Girl then interrupted Brainy, talking about a conversation they had not had yet, frustrating him even further. Later, Dream Girl, Karate Kid, <a href=\"../../shadow-lass/29-1261/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Shadow Lass</a> and Brainiac 5 were all sent to Dream Girl's home planet of Naltor to investigate why no one under the age of 18 was able to sleep.</p><p>Brainiac 5 eventually realized that he was in love with her, right before she was killed in the battle that destroyed most of the Legion Headquarters.

At the beginning of the story arc several members of the Legion (including the original Dream Girl in her classic silver costume) mysteriously appeared in the 21st century. Other Legionnaires were scattered and trapped in different places throughout the universe. Dream Girl was captured and imprisoned by the nightmarish villain <a href=\"../../doctor-destiny/29-10453/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Dr. Destiny</a> in <a href=\"../../arkham-asylum/34-31682/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Arkham Asylum</a>, where her precognitive powers were manipulated into giving her horrific illusions. She was rescued by the <a href=\"../../justice-society-of-america/65-27589/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Justice Society</a> and <a href=\"/justice-league-of-america/4060-31815/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-31815\">Justice League</a>, and was reunited with her longtime love Thom Kallor (formerly Star Boy), who had been flung back in time to become the new <a href=\"../../starman/29-7646/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Starman</a>. In this revised history the relationship between the two was more tragic, since Starman suffered mental damage after being hurtled back through time unprepared. She felt terribly for him and believed that the 21st-century methods of treating his mental illness were barbaric. Dream Girl has since established a connection to the realm of '<a href=\"/the-dreaming/4020-55857/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-55857\">The Dreaming</a>,' further enhancing her precognitive powers. She also correctly predicted the threat of <a href=\"../../superman-prime/29-40756/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Superboy-Prime</a> in <a href=\"../../final-crisis/39-51642/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Final Crisis</a>: <a href=\"../../final-crisis-legion-of-three-worlds/49-22674/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Legion of Three Worlds</a>, the recent storyline which united all three versions of the Legion together. After the <a href=\"/last-stand-of-new-krypton/4045-56041/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-56041\">war</a> with <a href=\"/new-krypton/4020-56084/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-56084\">New Krypton</a> in the 21st century, Dream Girl was able to bring Star Boy back home to the 31st century to get him the medical treatment he needed.</p><p> </p><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><h3><b>Original Continuity: New Earth</b></h3><h4>Romance with Star Boy</h4><p>Though Nura continued to receive constant attention from the unattached male Legionnaires (and even some of the attached ones), <a href=\"../../star-boy/29-1260/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Star Boy</a> (Thom Kallor) was the one who eventually managed to capture her heart. Nura became very close to him and she was romantically involved with Star Boy for many years. Dream Girl spent several years as someone who needed to be rescued, partly due to her effective but non-combative power. Not wanting to be a liability she trained intensively in hand-to-hand combat in order to better serve the team on the field. She was a quick study and became a highly skilled martial artist, second on the team in unarmed combat to only <a href=\"../../karate-kid/29-1269/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Karate Kid.</a> Her precognitive power to foresee an opponent's moves before they even made them further enhanced her effectiveness as a fighter.</p><p> </p><h4>Leaving The Legion</h4><p>At one point Nura took a temporary leave from the team, since she believed she had initially joined under false pretenses. She had foreseen the deaths of some Legionnaires while dreaming and proceeded to get those Legionnaires expelled from the Legion in order to save their lives. During this time she joined the <a href=\"../../legion-of-substitute-heroes/65-47111/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Legion of Substitute Heroes</a> until she reunited with Star Boy, who had been previously expelled from the Legion for accidentally killing Nura's former lover, a Naltorian named Kenz Nahor, in self-defense after Nahor attempted to kill Star Boy out of jealousy.</p><p> </p><h4>Leader of the Legion</h4><p>Dream Girl soon rejoined the Legion and continued serving as a highly valued member. After <a href=\"../../lightning-lad/29-1253/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Lightning Lad</a>'s term as Legion leader went horribly awry, the team decided it was time to elect a new leader, and Dream Girl announced that she was officially running for the position. The other candidates initially scoffed at the idea of the Legion's glamor girl winning the job, until they realized to their dismay that she would not have announced her candidacy had she not already foreseen herself winning. Sure enough, Dream Girl was elected leader, becoming only the second female Legionnaire ever to do so (after <a href=\"../../saturn-girl/29-1273/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Saturn Girl</a>).</p><p>Shortly after she assumed leadership the Legion was faced with one of the most dire challenges in their history -- the <a href=\"../../great-darkness-saga/39-40773/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Great Darkness Saga</a>. The ancient super-villain <a href=\"../../darkseid/29-2349/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Darkseid</a> attempted to conquer the whole of the United Planets. He very nearly succeeded, but the Legion, with Dream Girl's able leadership, finally managed to thwart him after an epic and costly struggle. During this time Nura's sister, Mysa Nal, arrived to aid the team with her mastery of the magical arts. Afterwards Mysa became a Legionnaire, calling herself the <a href=\"../../white-witch/29-30998/\" rel=\"nofollow\">White Witch</a>.</p><p>Though Dream Girl again ran for leader the following term, she lost out to Element Lad. Star Boy made no effort to hide his satisfaction about this result. During her stint as leader, their relationship had suffered. After Star Boy left the team to become planetary champion of his home planet, <a href=\"/xanthu/4020-56504/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-56504\">Xanthu</a>.</p><p> </p><h4>The Universo Project</h4><p>Dream Girl became one of the first Legion members to demonstrate sufficient willpower to utilize her Legion Flight Ring on an object other than herself, effectively giving her the ability of telekinesis. She later was one of four Legionnaires singled out by <a href=\"/universo/4005-22717/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-22717\">Universo</a> as the most dangerous obstacles in his attempt to take over the Earth (along with Saturn Girl, Brainiac 5, and Chameleon Boy). The four were captured and held prisoner with their memories suppressed. Saturn Girl eventually regained her memory and helped her teammates engineer an escape, after which they turned the tables on Universo. It was assumed that they were isolated as the most dangerous because they were the smartest Legionnaires, but it also could have been that those four had the most resistance to Universo's mind control -- even more than the Legion's (then current) telepath, <a href=\"/tellus/4005-30996/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-30996\">Tellus</a>.</p><p> </p><h4>Mind-controlled by Atmos</h4><p>When the ruler of Xanthu (Star Boy's home planet) asked Thom to be their resident hero since their champion <a href=\"/atmos/4005-28222/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-28222\">Atmos</a> had gone missing, Star Boy reluctantly had to take his leave from the Legion and Nura. While Star Boy was away, Atmos turned up during a Legion mission and Nura inexplicably found herself intensely attracted to him. To the surprise of her teammates, she broke up her long-distance relationship with Star Boy and jumped into a romance with Atmos. The truth later became apparent to her that Atmos was somehow using his mental powers to take over her emotions and sap her will. Furious at being so manipulated, she used her own formidable willpower to slowly build up a tolerance to Atmos' mind-sapping powers. She kept this a secret from her erstwhile lover until one night when Atmos had fallen asleep. She regained enough control over herself to activate her Legion flight ring alarm and knocked Atmos out cold with one punch the moment he woke up. Free of Atmos' influence, Nura immediately went back to her true love Thom.</p><p> </p><h4>Five Years Later</h4><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/80419/1888499-dg30.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1888499\" data-size=\"small\" style=\"width: 103px\" data-ratio=\"2.3495145631068\" data-width=\"103\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:235.0%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/80419/1888499-dg30.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1888499\"><img alt=\"High Seer (Five Years Later)\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 103px) 100vw, 103px\" data-width=\"103\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/80419/1888499-dg30.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/80419/1888499-dg30.jpg 103w\"><noscript><img alt=\"High Seer (Five Years Later)\" src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/80419/1888499-dg30.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/80419/1888499-dg30.jpg 103w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 103px) 100vw, 103px\" data-width=\"103\"></noscript></a><figcaption>High Seer (Five Years Later)</figcaption></figure><p>After the devastation of the <a href=\"/the-magic-wars/4045-56080/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-56080\">Magic Wars</a>, Legion continuity was re-started after the period known as the Five Year Gap. The galactic economy had collapsed and Earth's government became very hostile towards the Legion. Nura left the team and made her return to Naltor to become its High Seer. She steered Naltor successfully through the troubled times, and under her leadership her world became one of the most stable economies in the United Planets. But Nura felt alone and missed Star Boy terribly, so she went through a series of relationships with several men during this time. In early 2996, after a flash of light that seemed to indicate some sort of time flux, Dream Girl joined her former teammates on Earth, and just before the destruction of the time line, she shared a kiss with her old flame Star Boy before they were wiped out of existence due to the <a href=\"../../zero-hour/39-40782/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Zero Hour</a> event.</p><p> </p><h3>Threeboot: Earth-Prime</h3><h4>Guiding the Legion</h4><p>On Naltor, the Legionnaires brought a crazed teen before the high council and Dream Girl demanded to know what was being done to fix the problem. She also explained that without dreams, Naltorians could not interpret their visions and would eventually lose their precognitive abilities. The high council of Nltro claimed that the lack of sleep was a disease and not to worry, since it would work itself out. After it was discovered that it was actually the adults committing the crime against the children, Brainiac 5 took off, leaving the other three Legionnaires to fight the Precommandos (Precog Cops). The cops lay a beating on Karate Kid and Shadow Lass, until Dream Girl distracted the police so that they focused their attention solely on her. Taking advantage of the distraction, her teammates took the cops down. Dream Girl knew that more precogs were on the way, but she also knew that there was something the high council did not want the kids to see. She tried to get Karate Kid to knock her out but he refused, so Shadow Lass blindsided her with a mean right hand. Dream Girl then viewed the Destruction of the Universe by an unknown enemy and his army. When she woke up she said one word... 'Brainy'. Dream Girl lead the team to the public service broadcaster where they found Brainy \"attacking the problem\" as he put. It came down to Dream Girl having to choose either to let the youth know what she saw and how little time they had left, or security and comfort. She chose the former.</p><p> </p><h4>Relationship with Brainiac 5</h4><p>When the team returned to Legion headquarters, Brainiac 5 explained to Dream Girl how all it would take was one person, one casualty to have the willpower to break destiny; that the universe was more unpredictable than they gave it credit for and her visions did not have to be infallible. Dream Girl told him he would feel differently once they were married.</p><p> </p><h4>Foreseeing Her Own Death</h4><p>After this the Legion's true enemy was revealed: The terrorist group called <a href=\"../../terra-firma/65-47457/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Terra Firma</a>, lead by the super-powered <a href=\"../../elysion/29-1274/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Elysion</a> and <a href=\"../../lemnos/29-1268/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Lemnos</a>. Terra Firma attacked the planet Helegyn. During this attack Dream girl had a vision but could not see past one hour; after that, all she saw was black. After Elysion was captured, Dream Girl took out her frustrations on him. As she did so, Dream Girl expressed faith, something unheard of for precogs. Brainiac 5 and Dream Girl had a romantic moment while he tried to figure out her problem. Then Terra Firma made their move, just as Dream Girl had foreseen. They suicide-bombed Legion Tower and the plaza where teens had gathered to support the Legion. Brainiac 5 and Dream Girl headed there. Elysion escaped and, using his earth-controlling powers, brought down Legion Tower on top of everyone around. Amid the chaos, the answer to Dream Girl's problem was answered... she could not see past her own death. Dream Girl was crushed in the rubble of Legion Tower.</p><h4>Return to Life</h4><p>After she died, Brainiac 5 activated his force field around her dug-out body, which was still in remarkably good condition despite its physical death. Later it was revealed that Brainiac 5 had placed Dream Girl's body in stasis and was using a captured Lemnos try to bring her back to life. At the end of the story arc, he was shown to be successful: Nura's consciousness was transferred into a newly cloned version of her original body with her powers and sight fully restored. In the final issue of this continuity, the happy pair announced to the rest of the team their plans to get married.</p><p> </p><h3>Retroboot: New Earth</h3><h4>The New 52</h4><p>The efforts of DC to revitalize its titles led to the New 52 reboot of the universe, in which all DC titles were relaunched simultaneously. The Legion of Super Heroes reverted to a close analogue of their original continuity prior to any of reboots, but it remains to be seen the extent of any changes between the old series and new. Dream Girl and Star Boy are once again an official couple, though she also appears to have a strong relationship with <a href=\"/brainiac-5/4005-1255/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1255\">Brainiac 5</a>.</p><p> </p><h2>Powers &amp; Abilities</h2><h3>Precognition</h3><p>Dream Girl has the ability to see the future in dreams and visions. This is a power shared by all natives of her home planet Naltor, but Nura's ability to do so is considered to be among the strongest of her race. In addition to the long-range precognition of her dreams, Dream Girl also has the power of short term precognition when in a conscious state, allowing her to see a few seconds into the future at any given moment.</p><p><strong>Unarmed Combat</strong></p><p>Because of her passive power, Dream Girl's early portrayal was a damsel-in-distress who could be easily defeated and captured by enemies, obliging her teammates to rescue her. She resolved to change this and spent long hours with the Legion's ultimate martial arts master, Karate Kid, who gave her extensive training in hand-to-hand combat. She quickly became one of his most gifted students, to the point where she is now the second-most skilled martial artist on the team. Her fighting ability is greatly enhanced by her power to see seconds into the future, which allows her to predict her opponent's moves even before they make them and map out a battle before it actually begins. This makes her a very formidable tactician, and she is able to successfully combat enemies physically far stronger than her, such as the <a href=\"/\">Persuader</a>.</p><h3>Intellect</h3><p>Nura also possesses a genius-level intellect, and has mastered the highly advanced principles of Naltorian Science. She is one of the few Legionnaires to have received a compliment from Brainiac 5 for intellectual prowess. Because of her great intellect she was chosen for capture by the villain Universo, since he regarded her as one of the Legion's four biggest threats to his domination of Earth (the others being <a href=\"/saturn-girl/4005-1273/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1273\">Saturn Girl</a>, <a href=\"/chameleon-boy/4005-5945/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-5945\">Chameleon Boy</a>, and Brainiac 5).</p><p> </p><h3>Equipment</h3><p>As a member of the Legion of Super-Heroes, Dream Girl possesses a <a href=\"../../legion-flight-ring/18-47353/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Legion Flight Ring</a>. The ring gives its wearer the ability to fly, the speed and range of which is determined by the wearer's willpower. It also acts as a long-range communicator (enabling constant vocal contact with other Legionnaires, even across vast distances of space), a signal device, and a navigational compass, all powered by a micro-computer built inside the ring. Dream Girl has also employed the ring in various ways unknown to other Legionnaires. Using her great willpower, Nura has used the flight ring to levitate and move other nearby objects as though she has telekinesis.</p><p> </p><h2>Other Versions</h2><h3>Five Years Later: Batch SW6</h3><figure data-ref-id=\"1300-1982222\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/83063/1982222-dreamy01.jpg\" data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" style=\"width: 528px\" data-ratio=\"1.7405303030303\" data-width=\"528\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:174.1%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/83063/1982222-dreamy01.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1982222\"><img alt=\"Dream Girl (Batch SW6)\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 367px) 100vw, 367px\" data-width=\"367\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/8/83063/1982222-dreamy01.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/83063/1982222-dreamy01.jpg 528w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/8/83063/1982222-dreamy01.jpg 480w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/8/83063/1982222-dreamy01.jpg 367w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Dream Girl (Batch SW6)\" src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/8/83063/1982222-dreamy01.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/83063/1982222-dreamy01.jpg 528w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/8/83063/1982222-dreamy01.jpg 480w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/8/83063/1982222-dreamy01.jpg 367w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 367px) 100vw, 367px\" data-width=\"367\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Dream Girl (Batch SW6)</figcaption></figure><p>The devastation of the <a href=\"/the-magic-wars/4045-56080/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-56080\">Magic Wars</a> caused original Legion continuity to jump ahead five years in what is now known as the Five Year Gap.

Before Querl, his <a href=\"../../brainiac-4/29-69693/\" rel=\"nofollow\">mother</a>, a famous scientist for Colu, held the title. She abandoned Querl on his day of birth and he inherited her research. He was speaking by the time he was an infant and functionally working as a scientist by a toddler. Querl's research conflicted with Colu's and he was sent to do research for <a href=\"../../rj-brande/29-12810/\" rel=\"nofollow\">R.J. Brande</a>. Querl destroyed several of Brande's labs, and when Brande could no longer afford to keep him on staff, Brande sent him to work at the Time Institute on Talus. While there, he met Rond Vidar. Querl received a draft notice from Colu to join the Legion of Super-Heroes. He was so wrapped up in his work, that he ignored it. Once he was noticed as missing, he was brought into the Legion.</p><p>Joining the Legion as Brainiac 5, he was instrumental in many cases. He saved the Earth from the White Triangle, healed Triad, cured Andromeda's lead poisoning, and created the anti-gravity metal that was used in the Legion Flight Rings. He developed a crush on Andromeda, but after she was seemingly killed, he threw himself into his work. He made some new discoveries, and used them to travel back in time to save the hero, <a href=\"../../mon-el/29-21508/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Valor</a>. He was arrested by the United Planets, however, because time travel was illegal. He was pardoned when R.J. Brande became President and legalized time travel.

Early on Brainiac 5 comes into conflict with Legion leader <a href=\"../../cosmic-boy/29-1264/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Cosmic Boy</a> about the way he has been leading the team. Brainiac 5 is visited by <a href=\"../../lemnos/29-1268/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Lemnos</a> and is the only Legionnaire to later recall his face. Brainiac 5 broadcasts a conversation between Cosmic Boy and <a href=\"../../sun-boy/29-1259/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sun Boy</a>, causing a fight between the Legionnaires on his side and Cosmic Boy's supporters. Cosmic Boy is called back to his home planet and Brainiac 5 assumes leadership of the Legion. They reconciled later and moved forward as allies. <a href=\"../../dream-girl/29-1254/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Dream Girl</a> was killed during a Terra Firma attack and Brainiac 5 recovered her body and became obsessed with finding a way to resurrect her. He captured Lemnos to try and revive her, but the experiment destroyed her physical body. It did however leave her consciousness alive in Brainiac 5's dreams.</p><p>Later, Brainy's intellect turned the tide in the battle with the <a href=\"../../dominators/65-56539/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Dominators</a>. Brainy constructed a \"bomb\" , which was really a <a href=\"../../phantom-zone-projector/18-42369/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Phantom Zone projector</a>, which <a href=\"../../mon-el/29-21508/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mon-el</a> flew into the core of the Dominion Homeworld. He also created an anti-lead serum for Mon-El. Brainiac 5 invented a Chronexus that could view the past, and even open temporary time travel portals. With the help of <a href=\"../../evolvo-lad/29-12854/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Evolvo Lad</a>, he used the Chronexus to send <a href=\"../../supergirl/29-2351/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Supergirl</a> back to the 21st Century. After Cosmic Boy's disappearance, he manipulated events that resulted in the arrest of <a href=\"../../lightning-lord/29-3592/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mekt Ranzz</a>, boosting <a href=\"../../timber-wolf/29-3619/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Timber Wolf's</a> powers, and the recruitment of possible Legionnaire <a href=\"../../wildfire/29-3621/\" rel=\"nofollow\">E.R.G. 1</a>. Still, his ultimate goal was to bring Dream Girl back to life. Brainiac 5 spent more and more time sleeping to be with her. After a time, he proposed in the dream realm. After inventing a machine that could upload the Legionnaires' minds into an information-based reality and being forced to recreate their bodies, he created a body for Dream Girl as well, downloading her consciousness from his mind into the new body. He then invited the Legion to attend their wedding.</p><h3>Retroboot: New Earth</h3><figure style=\"width: 647px\" data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ref-id=\"1300-541904\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/8190/541904-fc_l3w_cv4_02.jpg\" data-ratio=\"1.3910355486862\" data-width=\"647\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:139.1%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/8190/541904-fc_l3w_cv4_02.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-541904\"><img alt=\"Brainiac 5 (New Earth)\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 690px) 100vw, 690px\" data-width=\"690\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/8190/541904-fc_l3w_cv4_02.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/8190/541904-fc_l3w_cv4_02.jpg 647w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Brainiac 5 (New Earth)\" src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/8190/541904-fc_l3w_cv4_02.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/8190/541904-fc_l3w_cv4_02.jpg 647w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 690px) 100vw, 690px\" data-width=\"690\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Brainiac 5 (New Earth)</figcaption></figure><p>The event known as <a href=\"../../infinite-crisis/39-40765/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Infinite Crisis</a> brought together the Legions of all three continuities. Afterward, the current Legion of Super-Heroes has returned to being a close approximation of the original Pre-Crisis team prior to the Five Year Later. Due to the removal of the original Supergirl and the <a href=\"../../retcon/12-43566/\" rel=\"nofollow\">retcon</a> addition of the latest Kara Zor-El, Brainiac 5's past was changed. He joined the Legion as before, but without Supergirl accompanying him. Brainiac 5 would later meet the current Kara Zor-El when she was stranded weeks later in the future. He was against the idea of letting her stay. She spent an extended period of time with the team, most notably when Satan Girl attacked Earth. The two teamed up to defeat her, sparking a young romance, before Kara returned home. During this period, Brainiac 5 intentionally rigged the founding Legionnaires' time bubble to visit Superboy rather than Superman. This resulted in Superboy's historic joining of the Legion of Super-Heroes.</p><p>Rejoining the Legion after the <a href=\"../../the-magic-wars/39-56080/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Magic Wars</a>, Brainy used his knowledge to help protect the galaxy once more by organizing several secret missions among the Legionnaires to help protect time. He sent a team back to the 21st Century with lightning rods to retrieve the essence of <a href=\"/\">Bart Allen</a> after his death as a secret weapon for the future. He also had arranged for <a href=\"/\">Starman</a>, Thom Kallor, to place <a href=\"/\">Superboy's</a> (Kon-El) body in the Kryptonian chrysalis in the 21st Century to be resurrected in the 31st.</p><p>Later, <a href=\"/\">Earth Man</a> caused a wave of xenophobia to spread on Earth. Brainy sent a Time Bubble to retrieve Superman for assistance. Deported due to his heritage, Brainy took over leadership of Colu to deter the <a href=\"/\">United Planets</a> from going to war with Earth. Superman finally arrived in the 31st Century months later, and helped defeat Earth Man's Justice League. When <a href=\"/\">Superboy-Prime</a> and the <a href=\"/\">Legion of Super-Villains</a> went on a rampage, Brainiac Five was used his previous contingencies of Superboy and Kid Flash to help turn the tide. He also recruited the Legion of Earth-247 and Earth-Prime to help. The Legionnaires eventually defeated the villains, though Earth-Man was forced by the government to join the Legion. Brainy made a special flight ring to keep Earth-Man under control but eventually awarded him a standard one. Presently, Brainiac 5 is investigating the mysterious <a href=\"../../harmonia-li/29-71175/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Harmonia Li</a>, a self proclaimed student of time travel and immortal.</p><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><h3><b>Original Continuity: New Earth</b></h3><h4>A insane Brainiac 5</h4><p>The computer tyrants of Colu, in the humanoid form known as <a href=\"../../pulsar-stargrave/29-52496/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Pulsar Stargrave</a>, claimed to be his real father, and caused Brainy to go mad for a time. Stargrave used Brainy to frame <a href=\"../../ultra-boy/29-1267/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ultra Boy</a> for the murder of An Ryd, but this was cleared up when <a href=\"../../chameleon-boy/29-5945/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Chameleon Boy</a> discovered that Stargrave was the true culprit. Still mad, Brainiac 5 accidentally created the vastly powerful <a href=\"../../infinite-man/29-51353/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Infinite Man</a>.

When <a href=\"../../glorith/29-26385/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Glorith</a> defeated the <a href=\"../../time-trapper/29-25998/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Time Trapper</a> and took his place in history, one of the biggest side-effects was that Supergirl was erased from the Legion's history and replaced with <a href=\"../../andromeda/29-6965/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Laurel Gand</a>. Laurel stayed on with the Legion continuously, unlike Supergirl, and she and Brainy enjoyed a lengthy and healthy romance when they were young. However, he began to neglect her because he could not justify ignoring his responsibilities for romantic pursuits. In this new history, after the conspiracy to defeat <a href=\"../../glorith/29-26385/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Glorith</a> and his subsequent expulsion from the Legion, he left Earth for Colu without consulting Laurel and their relationship ended.</p><h4>Zero Hour</h4><p>Brainiac 5 traveled to Winath to help try to find a cure for the <a href=\"../../validus/29-21241/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Validus</a> plague. He then rejoined the Legion when they reformed after facing <a href=\"../../roxxas/29-21133/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Roxxas</a> the Butcher. Although both he and Laurel had rejoined, he felt uncomfortable around her, because she had found love with Brainy's best friend, Rond Vidar. An incident with Glorith left Brainiac 5's body aged, causing him to have to wear a special suit to allow mobility. He later went into hiding with the team when they were framed for aiding the <a href=\"../../khunds/65-18273/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Khunds</a>. Brainiac 5 was wiped out of existence by the time fluctuations of <a href=\"../../zero-hour/39-40782/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Zero Hour</a>, along with an SW6 'time clone' who had surfaced months prior among the <a href=\"../../legionnaires/49-4971/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Legionnaires</a>.</p><h3>Reboot: Earth-247</h3><h4>Brainiac 5 becomes Brainiac 5.1</h4><p>After returning to the 30th Century, Brainy and others helped Andromeda investigate an anomaly in space. Once out of the anomaly, Brainy found himself changed. His personality was more friendly and there were grafts on his face that controlled his force field. <a href=\"../../gates/29-9969/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Gates</a> jokingly renamed him Brainiac 5.1, a name that stuck for a short time. After an attack on Earth by the Blight, Brainy was one of ten Legionnaires who were lost in a rift in space. After a year in the \"Second Galaxy\", Brainy was able to use <a href=\"../../shikari/29-5941/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Shikari's</a> pathfinding abilities to lead them home. Once home, they were soon threatened by Robotica, a collective of artificial intelligence. Brainiac 5 learned that this collective was engineered by Computo, whom he had created while in the 20th century. Computo had survived through the ages and considered itself to be Brainy's progeny. Later, Brainiac 5 and the other Legionnaires barely survived the destruction of Earth-247 during the <a href=\"../../infinite-crisis/39-40765/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Infinite Crisis</a>. They were brought to New Earth by that Earth's Brainiac 5. After the Legions of Three Worlds defeated Superboy-Prime and the Legion of Super-Villains, Brainy and the other Legionnaires from Earth-247 chose to explore the <a href=\"../../dc-multiverse/12-43603/\" rel=\"nofollow\">multiverse</a> as the \"New Wanderers\".</p><h2>Powers and Abilities</h2><h3>Intellect</h3><figure style=\"width: 180px\" data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1711621\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/63864/1711621-180px_628787_16_querl_dox_super.jpg\" data-ratio=\"0.91111111111111\" data-width=\"180\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:91.1%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/63864/1711621-180px_628787_16_querl_dox_super.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1711621\"><img alt=\"12th Level Intelligence\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 180px) 100vw, 180px\" data-width=\"180\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/63864/1711621-180px_628787_16_querl_dox_super.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/63864/1711621-180px_628787_16_querl_dox_super.jpg 180w\"><noscript><img alt=\"12th Level Intelligence\" src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/63864/1711621-180px_628787_16_querl_dox_super.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/63864/1711621-180px_628787_16_querl_dox_super.jpg 180w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 180px) 100vw, 180px\" data-width=\"180\"></noscript></a><figcaption>12th Level Intelligence</figcaption></figure><p>While the population of 20th century Earth has a 6th level intelligence, and average <a href=\"../../coluans/65-55891/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Coluans</a> have a 10th level intelligence, Brainiac 5 has a 12th level intelligence. Hence, Brainiac 5 is known as the smartest person in the universe.</p><p>He is able to create very advanced technology such as time machines (such as the Time Cube, Time Spheres and Chronexus), Flight Rings, artificial intelligences, and Force Shields. Brainy is also knowledgeable with medical technology as well, having invented the anti-lead serum for Mon-El and curing Matter-Eater Lad of his madness. Each level of intelligence represents a separate thought track, allowing him to think about or solve twelve equations simultaneously. His brain processes formulas at the speed of a computer.</p><p>While physical combat is not something he excels at, he has been known to use his body physics in combat to defend himself or incapacitate opponents. His advanced intellect presents a challenge when people try to affect him with mental abilities - he just thinks faster than they do. He has been known to learn new languages in just hours of listening to conversation.While it is not often illustrated, he excels at using technology in all forms (he is one of the Legion's best pilots), or finding weak spots in other people technology. With his powerful mind he can regulate his body's automatic nervous features with ease.</p><h3>Equipment</h3><p>Brainiac 5 has several other equipment items at his disposal. Brainiac's personal force field belt is nearly impenetrable when it is active. One version of his force field belt is used by <a href=\"../../booster-gold/29-1786/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Booster Gold</a>. In some iterations, like the Brainiac 5 of Earth-247, this force field is actually internalized. As a Legionnaire, he is equipped with a Legion flight ring which allows him to fly. It can also be used as a long-range communication and tracking device.</p><p>As a member of the Legion of Super-Heroes, Brainiac 5 possesses a <a href=\"../../legion-flight-ring/18-47353/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Legion Flight Ring</a>. The ring gives its wearer the ability to fly, the speed and range of which is determined by the wearer's willpower. It also acts as a long-range communicator (enabling constant vocal contact with other Legionnaires, even across vast distances of space), a signal device, and a navigational compass, all powered by a micro-computer built inside the ring. In the postboot reality, he had a utility belt which provided rations, a <a href=\"../../legion-transuits/18-56566/\" rel=\"nofollow\">transuit</a>, and telepathic ear plugs.</p><h2>Other Versions</h2><h3>Five Years Later / Batch SW6</h3><figure style=\"width: 666px\" data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-959731\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/31666/959731-brainiac_1.jpg\" data-ratio=\"1.6921921921922\" data-width=\"666\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:169.2%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/31666/959731-brainiac_1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-959731\"><img alt=\"Brainiac 5 (Batch SW6)\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 378px) 100vw, 378px\" data-width=\"378\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/3/31666/959731-brainiac_1.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/31666/959731-brainiac_1.jpg 666w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/31666/959731-brainiac_1.jpg 480w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/3/31666/959731-brainiac_1.jpg 378w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Brainiac 5 (Batch SW6)\" src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/3/31666/959731-brainiac_1.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/31666/959731-brainiac_1.jpg 666w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/31666/959731-brainiac_1.jpg 480w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/3/31666/959731-brainiac_1.jpg 378w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 378px) 100vw, 378px\" data-width=\"378\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Brainiac 5 (Batch SW6)</figcaption></figure><p>During the Dominators' subjugation of Earth, the members of their highly classified \"Batch SW6\" escaped captivity.

He was voiced by Matt Czurchy.</p><p><b>Superman &amp; the Legion of Super-Heroes</b></p><figure style=\"width: 482px\" data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ref-id=\"1300-878425\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/26503/878425-brainy5.jpg\" data-ratio=\"0.73651452282158\" data-width=\"482\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:73.7%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/26503/878425-brainy5.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-878425\"><img alt=\"Brainiac 5 (S&amp;LSH)\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/2/26503/878425-brainy5.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/26503/878425-brainy5.jpg 482w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/2/26503/878425-brainy5.jpg 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Brainiac 5 (S&amp;LSH)\" src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/2/26503/878425-brainy5.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/26503/878425-brainy5.jpg 482w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/2/26503/878425-brainy5.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Brainiac 5 (S&amp;LSH)</figcaption></figure><p>Brainiac 5 was a main character in both seasons of the Legion's own cartoon. This version and all of Colu were depicted as robotic lifeforms who could transform themselves into an armored state and create techno-organic energy weapons. This abilities replaced Brainy's force field belt in this universe. This Brainiac 5 was one of the Legionnaires to travel to the past to recruit a young Superman, the start of Brainy's lengthy admiration of the Boy of Steel. He was instrumental in the first season in defeating several threats and especially coordinating the Legion's efforts on missions.</p><p>During the second season two years in the future, Brainiac 5 has upgraded his look and travels to the 41st century to help save history. He brings Superman back onto the team and ultimately reveals to Kal-el his connection to the villainous Brainiac, causing a rift between the two friends. Determined to not become like his ancestor, Brainy accessed a part of his programming that was from the original Brainiac in order to increase his own knowledge. This backfired as it allowed Brainiac to slowly corrupt Brainiac 5, ultimately turning him into his host for his return. The entire Legion assembled and it was Superman who helped free Brainiac 5 from his ancestor's control. The resulting purge of Brainiac's programming converted Brainiac 5 into a human being for the first time. Ashamed of his actions and wishing to learn about his new found humanity, Brainy left the Legion in the serie's finale.</p><p><b>Smallville</b></p><p>In the episode entitled \"Legion,\" the Legion founders travel to the past to defeat Brainiac. Once they have collected Brainiac's mind and plan to return to the future, Saturn Girl remarked that she hoped \"Brainiac 5\" would be better behaved. It is implied that Brainy would now be a robotic or artificial construct with the original Brainiac's schematic.</p>",

As a result, young Lyle was predominantly raised by the Foccart family. A child prodigy, Lyle became interested in chemistry at an early age thanks to the Foccarts. Initially, he only created and patented things like new flavors of ice cream, but soon became more complex with his creations. His greatest invention was a serum that bent light around his body and clothing, rendering him invisible at will. EarthGov became interested in Lyle's discovery and enlisted him to do some investigative work for them. He was joined by the powerless Jacques Foccart, whom Lyle considered a brother, and the young woman who would one day become the villainous <a href=\"/charma/4005-52495/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-52495\">Charma</a>. Lyle's knowledge of the <a href=\"/durlans/4060-42477/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-42477\">Durlan</a> language and close friendship with <a href=\"/\">Chameleon</a> suggests that he spent time on <a href=\"/durla/4020-57515/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-57515\">Durla</a> during these days. On his last mission, Lyle was tricked into stealing his own formula. Jacques consumed it, but unlike Lyle he appeared to simply fade from existence. Disgusted, Lyle quit EarthGov and was instead drafted by Earth into the Legion of Super-Heroes.</p><h3>Threeboot: Earth-Prime</h3><figure style=\"width: 283px\" data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/26503/608517-invisiblekid1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-608517\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"1.2932862190813\" data-width=\"283\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:129.3%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/26503/608517-invisiblekid1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-608517\"><img alt=\"Invisible Kid (Earth-Prime)\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 283px) 100vw, 283px\" data-width=\"283\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/26503/608517-invisiblekid1.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/26503/608517-invisiblekid1.jpg 283w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Invisible Kid (Earth-Prime)\" src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/26503/608517-invisiblekid1.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/26503/608517-invisiblekid1.jpg 283w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 283px) 100vw, 283px\" data-width=\"283\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Invisible Kid (Earth-Prime)</figcaption></figure><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Lyle was a child prodigy in this reality who was asked by his father and the government to create an invisibility serum. Upon learning that his father had planned to give it away for military use, Lyle decided to inject himself with the only sample so that it could never fall upon abusive hands. He lied about injecting himself, claiming instead the serum never worked. Lyle then contacted his colleague, <a href=\"/brainiac-5/4005-1255/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1255\">Brainiac 5</a> of the Legion of Super-Heroes, for help in escaping from his parents who had registered him on public service. Lyle and Brainy had previously collaborated on the Legion flight rings. Brainy sponsored Lyle for Legion membership and he was accepted as Invisible Kid. At odds with his parents for running away, especially his military father, Lyle would later reconcile with the Norgs.</p><h3>Retroboot: New Earth</h3><figure style=\"width: 500px\" data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/65423/2156373-lylenorg.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2156373\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.654\" data-width=\"500\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:165.4%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/65423/2156373-lylenorg.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2156373\"><img alt=\"Invisible Kid (New Earth)\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" data-width=\"500\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/65423/2156373-lylenorg.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/65423/2156373-lylenorg.jpg 500w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/6/65423/2156373-lylenorg.jpg 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Invisible Kid (New Earth)\" src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/65423/2156373-lylenorg.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/65423/2156373-lylenorg.jpg 500w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/6/65423/2156373-lylenorg.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" data-width=\"500\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Invisible Kid (New Earth)</figcaption></figure><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">The events of <a href=\"../../infinite-crisis/39-40765/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Infinite Crisis</a> brought together the Legions of all three continuities.

During the battle, Lyle's flight ring blew up, and he lost his arm. He received an arm graft for a short period of time before a proper arm could be regrown for him. He developed feelings for time-lost member <a href=\"../../supergirl/29-2351/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Supergirl</a>, who didn't reciprocate and ultimately left the team. On a mission to Triton, Lyle developed feelings for a local girl named <a href=\"../../gazelle/29-50438/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Giselle</a> who had been ridiculed by her people, but was afraid to show himself to her. To investigate matters that didn't fall under the Legion's proper jurisdiction, Lyle formed the top-secret Legion Espionage Squad and served as its leader. Eventually, Giselle joined the Legion as Gazelle. Lyle, still hiding from his crush, used virtual reality to make himself appear older and buffer than he truly was.

As a Legionnaire, Tinya's unique phasing abilities made her a crucial contact between Earth and the Phantom Zone. Tinya and Jo Nah (<a href=\"../../ultra-boy/29-1267/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ultra Boy</a>) became one of the earliest Legion couples. Tinya was so taken with Jo that she was willing to aid him even when it was thought he had betrayed the Legion. The two have since formed of the Legion's most enduring couples. Phantom Girl became a founding member of the Legion Espionage Squad and became best friends with Tasmia Mallor (<a href=\"/shadow-lass/4005-1261/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1261\">Shadow Lass</a>), and Tinya and Jo would often double-date with Tasmia and her boyfriend <a href=\"/mon-el/4005-21508/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-21508\">Mon-el</a>. After an incident when Ultra Boy was thought dead, Tinya mourned greatly. She was later ecstatic to discover he was alive but had simply had amnesia. Tinya eventually became the most senior Legionnaire, and has served in the Legion without any absences longer than anyone else in history. As a founder of the Legion Espionage Squad, Tinya displayed remarkable leadership qualities. Despite this, she remained the longest-serving Legionnaire never to be elected as Legion leader (until very recently).</p><p>Phantom Girl's original costume consisted of white tights and a cape, with a stylized black 'P' on her chest. Like many Legionnaires she underwent a sexy makeover in the 1970's, losing the cape and wearing a white jumpsuit with wide sleeves, bell-bottom pants, bare shoulders, and revealing rectangular openings down the front of her chest. This \"portholes &amp; bell-bottoms\" costume became her signature look, and is the basis for her current costume.</p><h3>Reboot: Earth-247</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/29837/795206-phantomgirl_apparition_ah.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-795206\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"2.1072961373391\" data-width=\"233\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 233px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:210.7%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/29837/795206-phantomgirl_apparition_ah.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-795206\"><img alt=\"Apparition: Earth-247\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 233px) 100vw, 233px\" data-width=\"233\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/29837/795206-phantomgirl_apparition_ah.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/29837/795206-phantomgirl_apparition_ah.jpg 233w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Apparition: Earth-247\" src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/29837/795206-phantomgirl_apparition_ah.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/29837/795206-phantomgirl_apparition_ah.jpg 233w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 233px) 100vw, 233px\" data-width=\"233\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Apparition: Earth-247</figcaption></figure><p>After the event called <a href=\"../../zero-hour/39-40782/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Zero Hour</a>, Legion history was completely rebooted, with this reality later designated as <b>Earth-247</b>. Tinya was again one of the earliest Legion recruits, though in this continuity she took the code name <b>Apparition</b> rather than Phantom Girl. Bgztl was now an actual planet in the United Planets, rather than a dimensional neighbor, and Tinya's mother, <a href=\"/winema-wazzo/4005-12817/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-12817\">Winema</a>, served as Bgztl's ambassador. Tinya lived with her mother on Earth with no family, having been born to her mother and a drifter. Tinya and Winema were both unaware her father was a Carggite and that Tinya was as well. When she was born and Winema was asleep, he stole two of the three Tinya bodies and sold them off to the Luck Lords. Ignorant of this, Tinya was raised with all the spoils of Winema's career. Apparition joined the Legion after she helped foil an assassination plot at a UP conference, the first recruit alongside Triad. While a Legionnaire, she often argued with her mother. This was especially so when Tinya started to fall in love with the unbecoming Ultra Boy of the <a href=\"/workforce/4060-47189/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-47189\">Workforce</a>. The two dated in secret and professed their love to each other just as a Daxamite terrorist fried them with heat vision, killing Tinya.

Tinya Wazzo again went by the Phantom Girl codename and was a member of the Legion. She was a fan of old Earth comic books and had the biggest collection among the heroes. Bgtzl was now a world that was slightly out of phase with Earth and her phasing ability was actually her transporting herself between the planets. She was able to pass back and forth these worlds at will and could often be seen in both, regardless of what she might be doing in one. This led to strange situations and misunderstandings with her teammates. A friend and teammate, <a href=\"/\">Karate Kid</a>, had shown interest in Tinya. But when he finally got the courage to profess his feelings to Phantom Girl, he discovered that she was already in a relationship with a boy from her own dimension who was ironically breaking up with Tinya at the time. Phantom Girl became a member of the Legion's Espionage Squad and assisted covertly on many stealth missions, and was also instrumental in entering the Phantom Zone to help rescue Mon-El. Phantom Girl and Ultra Boy never became an item in this continuity.</p><p>The Earth-Prime Phantom Girl had a darker skin tone than her predecessors and brown eyes instead of the usual blue, giving her a more exotic look. She wore a sexy white costume with revealing oval-shaped openings on her arms, thighs, and midriff, and one large oval opening on her chest (reminiscent of <a href=\"/power-girl/4005-4915/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4915\">Power Girl</a>'s famous cleavage window).</p><h3>Retroboot: New Earth</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/29837/1623759-phantomgirl_adventure522_cover.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1623759\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.0196483971044\" data-width=\"967\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 967px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:102.0%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/29837/1623759-phantomgirl_adventure522_cover.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1623759\"><img alt=\"Current Phantom Girl (New Earth)\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 627px) 100vw, 627px\" data-width=\"627\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/2/29837/1623759-phantomgirl_adventure522_cover.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/29837/1623759-phantomgirl_adventure522_cover.jpg 967w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/2/29837/1623759-phantomgirl_adventure522_cover.jpg 960w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/2/29837/1623759-phantomgirl_adventure522_cover.jpg 941w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/2/29837/1623759-phantomgirl_adventure522_cover.jpg 627w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Current Phantom Girl (New Earth)\" src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/2/29837/1623759-phantomgirl_adventure522_cover.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/29837/1623759-phantomgirl_adventure522_cover.jpg 967w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/2/29837/1623759-phantomgirl_adventure522_cover.jpg 960w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/2/29837/1623759-phantomgirl_adventure522_cover.jpg 941w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/2/29837/1623759-phantomgirl_adventure522_cover.jpg 627w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 627px) 100vw, 627px\" data-width=\"627\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Current Phantom Girl (New Earth)</figcaption></figure><p>The events of <a href=\"/infinite-crisis/4045-40765/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-40765\">Infinite Crisis</a> brought together the Legions of all three continuities.

Only Jo and her mother could initially see her, but soon <a href=\"../../saturn-girl/29-1273/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Saturn Girl</a> detected her and clued the rest of the Legionnaires in telepathically. While stranded in the 20th century, an encounter with <a href=\"../../deadman/29-5690/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Deadman</a> and a mystic entity made Apparition's spirit visible to all onlookers. Shortly thereafter, Tinya and Jo were secretly married. While in the past, Apparition encountered the heroine Phase. The pair were absorbed into their touchstones when they came near each other and learned Phase was actually one of Tinya's missing bodies, having been lost in time after being sold into slavery. Pulling together to save Ultra Boy, the girls merged for the first time and Apparition was restored to a physical form. Apparition then returned with the Legion to the 30th century and reunited with her mother.</p><h4>Pregnancy</h4><p>Tinya was on a mission in deep space when the Blight attacked, crippling space travel and forcing Tinya to spend a month in a shuttle just to return to Earth. There, she found Ultra Boy had been blighted and aided the Legion in freeing Earth. Subsequently, Ultra Boy and several other Legionnaires were lost in a spatial rift and presumed dead. The Legion disbanded and Apparition, discovering she was pregnant after Jo had \"died,\" fled to his homeworld of <a href=\"../../rimbor/34-57117/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Rimbor</a> to start a new life. Her Bgztlian pregnancy lasted a year, where she came under the protection of <a href=\"../../timber-wolf/29-3619/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Timber Wolf</a> and his Wolf Pack gang.</p><p>She had a healthy phase birth on the day the lost Legionnaires were revealed to be alive. Apparition resolved to rejoin the Legion with her newborn son, Cub, and Timber Wolf accompanied her to protect her. She learned that Ultra Boy had an affair with Saturn Girl during their year of being lost in space, but ultimately forgave him. The pair dealt with their son's rapid aging until Earth-247 was destroyed, leaving Apparition and her Legion the sole survivors as they were lost in the timestream. Tinya was equipped with a utility belt with rations and a transuit that allowed her to breathe in space.</p><h4>The Missing Body</h4><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/29837/846063-phantomgirl_lsh98.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-846063\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.14\" data-width=\"450\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 450px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:114.0%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/29837/846063-phantomgirl_lsh98.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-846063\"><img alt=\"Phase and Apparition reunited (Earth-247)\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 561px) 100vw, 561px\" data-width=\"561\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/29837/846063-phantomgirl_lsh98.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/29837/846063-phantomgirl_lsh98.jpg 450w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Phase and Apparition reunited (Earth-247)\" src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/29837/846063-phantomgirl_lsh98.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/29837/846063-phantomgirl_lsh98.jpg 450w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 561px) 100vw, 561px\" data-width=\"561\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Phase and Apparition reunited (Earth-247)</figcaption></figure><p>Late in Earth-247 continuity, it was revealed that Tinya's father was actually a Carggite (teammate <a href=\"/duplicate-girl/4005-1262/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1262\">Triplicate Girl</a>'s race), with the ability to split into three separate bodies, and Tinya had inherited this ability at birth.

Upon further investigation, Tinya discovered that Projectra was plotting to destroy the Legion in revenge. But before Tinya could alert the Legion, Projectra found her out and savagely attacked her.

Space</li><li><strong>Height</strong>: 5ft 6in</li><li><strong>Weight</strong>: 131 lbs</li><li><strong>Eyes</strong>: Blue</li><li><strong>Hair</strong>: Black</li></ul><h2>Powers and Abilities</h2><h3>Intangibility</h3><p>Phantom Girl has the ability to turn intangible by shifting her existence partially or fully into the extra-dimensional space known as the <a href=\"/phantom-zone/4020-42370/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-42370\">Phantom Zone</a>. When fully phasing out of reality, Tinya is able to enter the Phantom Zone of her own accord. She has also shown the ability to draw people into the Phantom Zone with her. Tinya is the only member of her race known to be able to phase herself completely through the Phantom Zone and onto Earth, which shares extra-dimensional space with her home planet of Bgztl.</p><p>While phased, Phantom Girl is immune to physical harm, can maneuver through solid objects, and float weightlessly like a ghost under her own power. Phantom Girl has demonstrated the ability to phase with split-second timing as well as the ability to phase certain parts of her body selectively, feats very few Bgztlians can accomplish. In her \"ghost\" incarnation she has demonstrated the ability to disrupt the workings of electronic devices by moving through them while half-phased.</p><h3>Hand-to-Hand Combat</h3><p>Phantom Girl has mastered a Bgztlian form of martial arts that takes full advantage of her ability to phase in and out of tangibility during combat. Her skill at striking opponents while solid and becoming intangible when they attack has made her a formidable fighter. By partially materializing a portion of herself (usually her arm/fist) inside her opponent's body she can also deliver a severe shock to their system, though she rarely resorts to this form of attack.</p><h3>Equipment</h3><p>As a member of the Legion of Super Heroes, Phantom Girl possesses a <a href=\"../../legion-flight-ring/18-47353/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Legion Flight Ring</a>. The ring gives its wearer the ability to fly, the speed and range of which is determined by the wearer's willpower. It also acts as a long-range communicator (enabling constant vocal contact with other Legionnaires, even across vast distances of space), a signal device, and a navigational compass, all powered by a micro-computer built inside the ring.</p><h2>Other Versions</h2><h3>20th Century: Phase</h3><p><b>For further details</b>: <a href=\"/phase/4005-12983/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-12983\">Phase</a></p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/8842/505628-tinyafront44.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-505628\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.4333333333333\" data-width=\"300\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 300px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:143.3%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/8842/505628-tinyafront44.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-505628\"><img alt=\"Phase (Enya Wazzo)\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" data-width=\"300\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/8842/505628-tinyafront44.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/8842/505628-tinyafront44.jpg 300w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Phase (Enya Wazzo)\" src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/8842/505628-tinyafront44.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/8842/505628-tinyafront44.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" data-width=\"300\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Phase (Enya Wazzo)</figcaption></figure><p>After Tinya Wazzo apparently died when her starship exploded (following the Five Year Gap), she seemingly reappeared in the 20th century, but with no memories of her life in the 30th century.

It was later revealed in Earth-247 continuity that the original Tinya was half-Carggite (Triplicate Girl's race), meaning that she could split into three separate bodies but had lost the ability because one of her bodies was missing in the timestream. Phase, also known as Enya Wazzo and originally believed to be Tinya's time-lost cousin, turned out to be that missing body. Upon learning of this, the 30th-century Tinya traveled back in time to find Enya.

She was voiced by Heather Hogan. This version of Phantom Girl was one of the youngest of the group and desperate to prove herself to the rest of the team. Her mother was president of the United Planets, which Tinya hated. Tinya's powers now allowed her to phase other objects from a distance. She was one of the biggest cheerleaders of the team and a bit of a princess. She wore a black and white costume patterned after her Earth-247 Apparition costume, but with a stylized 'ghost' logo on her chest.</p><p>In Season One, she stood against the <a href=\"/fatal-five/4060-42802/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-42802\">Fatal Five</a> in <i>Man of Tomorrow</i>. She warded off the villainous Scavengers in <i>Legacy</i> and attended the Intergalactic Games in <i>Champions</i>. She helped against Phantom Zone invaders in <i>Phantoms</i> and was instrumental in getting the <a href=\"/sorcerers-world/4020-56700/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-56700\">Sorcerers' World</a> to deal with a rogue magician in <i>Child's Play</i>. Although paired with Ultra Boy in <i>Sundown</i>, a romance between the two was never explored. By Season Two, Phantom Girl had formed a close friendship with Timber Wolf. He found her in debris during <i>Man from the Edge of Tomorrow, Part 2</i> and she was willing to turn against the Legion to protect him in <i>Cry Wolf</i>. She returned to the Sorcerer's World to defeat <a href=\"/mordru/4005-4904/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4904\">Mordru</a> in <i>Trials</i>.</p><h2>Popular Recognition</h2><p>Citing the revealing 'peekaboo' design of her costumes, Phantom Girl was ranked 96th in Comic Buyer's Guide's <a href=\"/comics-buyers-guide-presents-2-100-sexiest-women-i/4000-463770/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-463770\">100 Sexiest Women in Comics</a> list.
